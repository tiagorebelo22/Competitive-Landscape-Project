## Analytics Consulting Project: Competitive Landscape


The main objective of this project was to conduct an analysis of the competitive landscape for Ironhack in the coding school industry. We created a comprehensive database that included information about coding schools that directly competed with Ironhack, with at least 400 reviews in https://www.switchup.org/.
 
The project involved formulating SQL queries to address the following business questions:
 
1\. Overall Score:\
We evaluated the overall score of each coding school throughout the years to assess their performance and reputation.
 
2\. Number of students:\
We determined the number of students in each coding school over the years to understand their popularity and growth.

3\. Campus availability and variety of courses:\
We compared the geographical reach of each coding school and analyzed the diversity of courses offered to gain insights into their market presence and competitiveness.

By conducting this analytics consulting project, Ironhack gained valuable insights into the performance of their competitors. These insights will aid Ironhack in making informed decisions regarding their curriculum, campus expansion, and market positioning.
